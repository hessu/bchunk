	This is a Unix/C rewrite of the fine BinChunker software for some
	non-Unix system. The non-Unix version of BinChunker has been
	obsoleted by FireBurner, which can be found at www.fireburner.com.
	FireBurner does a lot more than BinChunker did, but can be used to
	do exactly the same even without a burner device installed.
	Thanks go to Bob Marietta, the author of BinChunker, for the
	extensive help, documentation and letting me look at his
	Pascal/Delphi source code!
	
	Colas Nahaboo <Colas@Nahaboo.com> and Godmar Back <gback@cs.utah.edu>
	added support for MODE2/2352 ISO data tracks in bchunk 1.1.0.
	Matthew Green implemented the -r option for raw MODE2/2352
	extraction for bchunk 1.2.0.

  What on earth is this stuff:
  
  	binchunker converts a CD image in a ".bin / .cue" format
  	(sometimes ".raw / .cue") to a set of .iso and .cdr tracks.
  	
  	It also allows to split uncompressed PCM audio files in the
  	WAV format into individual tracks.
  	
  	The bin/cue format is used by some non-Unix cd-writing
  	software, but is not supported on most other cd-writing
  	programs.
  	
  	The .iso track contains an ISO file system, which can be
  	mounted through a loop device on Linux systems ('mount track.iso
  	/mnt/cdrom -o loop=/dev/loop0,blocksize=1024'), or written on a
  	CD-R using cdrecord.
  	
  	The .cdr tracks are in the native CD audio format. They can
  	be either written on a CD-R using cdrecord -audio, or converted
  	to WAV (or any other sound format for that matter) using
  	sox ('sox track.cdr track.wav'). Audio tracks can be written
  	in WAV format by using the -w switch.
  	
  	The output type depends on the input type (data is just copied).
  	If the input is in ISO format, the output will be. On the other
  	hand, if the input is raw audio data, the output will be CDR or
  	WAV (the latter if -w is given).

  How to install this stuff:
  	
  	$ gzip -d -c bchunk-1.2.3.tar.gz | tar xvf -
  	$ cd bchunk-1.2.3
  	$ make
  	# make install
  	
  	If your system does not have GCC installed, edit Makefile,
  	uncommenting the CC lines.
  	
  	If your system does not ship with a BSD-style 'install' program and the
  	make install fails, copy the resulting 'bchunk' binary to your favourite
  	directory in your $PATH. /usr/local/bin is a good one. The manual page
  	'bchunk.1' should go to /usr/local/man/man1 for example.
  	
  	bchunk has been successfully compiled on the following platforms:
  	
  		Linux 2.0, i686, glibc 2.0.7, gcc 2.7.2.3  (RedHat 5.1)
  		Linux 2.2, i686, glibc 2.1.1, egcs 1.1.2 (RedHat 6.0)
  		Linux 2.4, i686, glibc 2.2, gcc-2.96 (RedHat 7.0)
  		Solaris 2.5.1, SPARC, gcc 2.7.2
  		Solaris 2.6, SPARC, gcc 2.8.1
  		Digital Unix 4.0c, Alpha, DEC C V5.2-033
  		SGI IRIX 6.5.7m, MIPS R4600 IP22, gcc 2.95.2
  		Mac OS X 10.1.4, gcc 2.95.2
  	
  	It should be ANSI enough to compile on any decent system.
  	(The HP-UX bundled compiler is not decent.)

  How to use this stuff:
  	
  	bchunk [-t] [-v] [-p (PSX)] [-r (raw)] [-w (wav)] [-s (swabaudio)]
         <image.bin | image.wav | track # | '*'> <image.cue> [ <basename> ]
  	
  	image.bin is a source raw cd image file and image.wav is an
  	uncompressed PCM audio file, either listed in the
  	cue sheet file as a FILE. track # identifies the track listed
  	in the cue sheet as a TRACK. The wildcard '*' (quoted)
  	selects all tracks for conversion. image.cue is the cue sheet
  	file containing filenames, track types and offsets. The optional
  	basename is used for the leading part of the output filenames.
  	By default, the output files are now named after the basename
  	of the source image file or the track #, ending with the
  	appropriate format extension. basename may contain the track
  	token ## which will be replaced by the track number.
	
	The -t flag adds the track # in the output filename between
	the basename & the extension, as in versions prior to 1.2.3.
	
	The -v flag makes binchunker print some more unnecessary
	messages, which should not be of interest for anyone.
	
	The -p flag makes binchunker go into PSX mode and truncate
	MODE2/2352 tracks to 2336 bytes at offset 0 instead of normal
	2048 bytes at offset 24.
	
	The -r flag makes binchunker output MODE2/2352 tracks in raw
	format, from offset 0 for 2352 bytes. Good for MPEG/VCD.
	
	The -p and -r flags works only with MODE2/2352 input (if input
	is in PSX mode pass -p flag or if it is in raw format pass
	-r flag).
	
	The -w flag makes binchunker write audio tracks in WAV format.
	
	The -s flag makes binchunker swap byte order in the samples of
	the audio tracks. If the audio sounds like loud static noise,
	try this.
