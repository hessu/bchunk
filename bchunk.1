.TH BCHUNK 1 "v1.2.3 30 Jun 2022" "Heikki Hannikainen"
.SH NAME
bchunk \- CD image format conversion from bin/cue to iso/cdr
and WAV file splitter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bchunk [-t] [-v] [-p] [-r] [-w] [-s]
<image.bin | image.wav | track # | '*'> <image.cue> [ <basename> ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B bchunk 
converts a CD image in a ".bin / .cue" format (sometimes ".raw / .cue") to a
set of .iso and .cdr tracks.
.LP
The bin/cue format is used by some non-Unix cd-writing
software, but is not supported on most other cd-writing
programs.
.LP
It also allows to split uncompressed PCM audio files in the
WAV format into individual tracks.
.LP
\fIimage.bin\fP is a raw cd image file and \fIimage.wav\fP is an
uncompressed  PCM audio file, either listed in the cue sheet file
as a FILE. \fItrack #\fP is the track number listed in the cue sheet
as a TRACK. \fItrack #\fP may omit the leading 0s. The wildcard
'\fI*\fP' (single quoted to prevent shell expansion) selects all
tracks from a cue sheet for conversion. \fIimage.cue\fP is the cue
sheet file containing track types and offsets. \fIbasename\fP is
optionally used for the leading part of output filenames.
\fIbasename\fP may contain the track token '##' which will be
replaced by the track number.
.LP
The produced .iso track contains an ISO file system, which can be
mounted through a loop device on Linux systems, or
written on a CD-R using cdrecord.
The .cdr tracks are in the native CD audio format. They can
be either written on a CD-R using cdrecord \(hyaudio, or converted
to WAV (or any other sound format for that matter) using
sox.
.LP
The output type depends on the input type (data is just copied).
If the input is in ISO format, the output will be. On the other
hand, if the input is raw audio data, the output will be CDR or
WAV (the latter if \(hyw is given).
.LP
It is advisable to edit the .cue file to either MODE2/2352/2048 or
MODE2/2352/2324 depending on whether an ISO filesystem or a VCD is
desired, respectively.
The format itself does not contain this feature and in an ambiguous
case it can only guess.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 10
.BI \-t
Adds the track # in the output filename between the basename &
the extension, as in
.B bchunk
releases prior to 1.2.3.
.TP 10
.BI \-v
Makes binchunker print some more unnecessary messages, which should
not be of interest for anyone.
.TP 10
.BI \-w
Makes binchunker write audio tracks in WAV format.
.TP 10
.BI \-s
Makes binchunker swap byte order in the samples of audio tracks.
.TP 10
.BI \-p
Makes binchunker go into PSX mode and truncate MODE2/2352 tracks to
2336 bytes at offset 0 instead of normal 2048 bytes at offset 24.
Use this option if input is in PSX mode.
.TP 10
.BI \-r
Makes binchunker output MODE2/2352 tracks in raw format, from offset
0 for 2352 bytes. Good for MPEG/VCD. Use this option if input is in
raw format.
.SH FILES
.LP
.TP 5
.B image.bin
Raw CD image file, listed in the cue sheet as a FILE.
.TP 5
.B image.wav
WAV file with uncompressed PCM audio, listed in the cue sheet
as a FILE.
.TP 5
.B image.cue
Cue sheet, TOC (Track index, Table Of Contents) file.
.TP 5
.B *.iso
Tracks in ISO9660 CD filesystem format. Can be either written on a
CD-R using cdrecord, or mounted (on Linux platforms at least)
through a loop device ('mount track.iso /mnt/cdrom \(hyo loop=/dev/loop0,blocksize=1024').
.TP 5
.B *.cdr
Audio tracks in native CD audio format. They can be either written on a
CD-R using 'cdrecord \(hyaudio', or converted to WAV (or any other sound
format for that matter) using sox ('sox track.cdr track.wav').
.TP 5
.B *.wav
Audio tracks in WAV format.
